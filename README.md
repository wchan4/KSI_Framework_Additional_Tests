# KSI_Framework_Additional_Tests

## How to Replicate Experimentation:

1. Clone the following GitHub repo (original paper's source code): https://github.com/tiantiantu/KSI

2. Move the files "KSI_LR.py" and "KSI_LSTM_Bidirectional.py" into main folder (if you want to test these models as well)

3. Set up Conda environment for python 3.7.0 and install the following packages using conda commands
- torch=
- sklearn=
- numpy=

4. Follow the instructions listed in the original GitHub repo (Recapped below)
- Run preprocessing1.py, preprocessing2.py, and preprocessing3.py (in that order)
- RUn the python file for any desired model tests
